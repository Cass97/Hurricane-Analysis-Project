# Hurricane-Analysis-Project
This was an off-platform project as part of the Python Dictionaries module in the Codecademy Data Science course. It was used for practical learning of Python Dictionaries. Also demonstrates understanding of Python loops, booleans, lists and functions.
I uploaded this notebook to GitHub long after I completed the project. I noticed some errors on questions 7 and 9 when preparing the notebook to upload. As with other Codecademy Q&A style projects, I have elected to leave any mistakes or omissions I notice at the time of uploading. This is because they are intended to be a record of my learning only and not judged as a formal assessment.
